> **"A Mini-Study on Drug-likeness and Chemical Space of Microbial Natural Products Using RDKit and PCA"**

## 📄 Abstract

This computational study explores the drug-likeness and chemical space of nine diverse microbial natural products using open-source Python tools. Physicochemical descriptors were computed using RDKit, and analyzed via PCA, t-SNE, clustering (KMeans, Agglomerative), and fingerprint-based similarity (Tanimoto). Visualization included radar plots, heatmaps, dendrograms, and bar plots. The goal was to identify whether these complex natural molecules fall within drug-like space, and how they cluster chemically.
